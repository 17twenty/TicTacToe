TicTacToe
==========

So I started off trying to write a simple Sudoku game but ended up going the 
simpler route and doing a simple version of tictactoe.

The coding is a little off key from my norm but it was a good learning
experience and I tried to touch on a few things I've not played with before.

Patches welcome, it'd be nice to work on something else - Vala is a joy!

To build:

<code>
valac --pkg gtk+-3.0 -o TicTacToe TicTacToeBox.vala TicTacToeBoard.vala TicTacToeWindow.vala
</code>
